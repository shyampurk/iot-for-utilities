#Hardware Build

##Step 1 : Power Supply

Build the power supply cicruit from the battery. This is emulating the grid supply in the form of DC with 5V and 12V output.


##Step 2 : Solar Panel Supply

Build the solar panel supply circuit. 


##Step 3 : Battery Charging Circuit

Build the battery charging circuit. This emulates the underutilized energy given back to grid from the solar panels.  


##Step 4 : Final Assembly

Final assembly to connect the current sensors and loads
